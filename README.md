# Accessibility-Manual
Guidance and best practice for building accessible services and meeting the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018.  This guidance is still being iterated and is likely to change.


<h2>Accessibility Law</h2>

Accessibility is a part of several laws and standards we must follow. Each of the standards feed into the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance) and the [Public Sector Equality Duty](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-sector-equality-duty)

They say that websites and mobile apps of public sector bodies need to meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and provide an accessibility statement.

If you are building anything which runs in a browser, you will need to meet the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018

If you are procuring hardware or software you will need to meet the EN 301 549 Accessibility Requirements for ICT products and services.

If you are working to the GOV.UK Service Standard you will also need to meet the Government Accessibility Requirements.

<h2>Guidance based on your role</h2>
 
Understand what responsibilities each role has when it comes to accessibility, and see what you might have to do in your current role. However, accessibility is a team sport, therefore everyone within the team should take responsibility in making sure the services we create are accessibile and inclusive.

This [guidance](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/guidance-for-your-job-role) is taken from DWP Accessibility Manual.
